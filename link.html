        <li>Explain the difference between absolute and relative <br><strong><br>Answer.. An absolute URL specifies the complete address of a web resource, including the protocol (e.g., http:// or https://), domain name, and the path to the specific resource. On the other hand, a relative URL specifies the location of a resource relative to the current page or location.</strong><br></li><br>
        <li>Provide an example of an absolute URL. <br><strong><br>Answer.. Example of an absolute URL:
            https://www.example.com/images/logo.png
            </strong><br></li><br>
        <li>What are the advantages of using relative URLs over absolute URLs?<br><strong><br>Answer..Advantages of relative URLs over absolute URLs:

            Portability: Relative URLs are more portable since they are not tied to a specific domain or protocol. This makes it easier to move or replicate content across different environments.
            Flexibility: Relative URLs allow for easier website maintenance as they can adapt to changes in domain names or directory structures without requiring updates to every link.
            Conciseness: Relative URLs are typically shorter and cleaner, improving readability and maintainability of the code.</strong><br></li><br>
        <li>How do you create a link to an email address in HTML?<br><strong><br>Answer..To create a link to an email address in HTML, you can use the mailto: scheme followed by the email address. Here's an example:

            html
            Copy code
            <a href="mailto:example@example.com">Send Email</a>
            When a user clicks on this link, it will open their default email client with a new message addressed to the specified email address.</strong><br></li><br>
        <li>Describe the purpose of the target attribute in an anchor tag. <br><strong><br>Answer..The target attribute in an anchor <a> tag is used to specify where the linked document should open when clicked. It determines the browsing context for the link, such as opening the linked document in a new window or tab. Common values for the target attribute include _blank to open the link in a new tab and _self to open it in the same tab.</strong><br></li><br>
        <li>What is a file path? How does it differ from a URL?<br><strong><br>Answer..A file path is a specific location within a file system that points to a file or directory. It specifies the precise route to reach a file or directory on a computer or server. File paths are typically written using a hierarchical structure, such as directories separated by slashes ("/") or backslashes ("").

            A URL (Uniform Resource Locator), on the other hand, is a specific type of file path that includes additional information needed to access resources over the internet. It consists of several components, including the protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), domain name, and optionally a path to a specific resource on the server. URLs often begin with "http://" or "https://" and are used to uniquely identify resources on the web. While a file path refers to a location within a file system, a URL points to a resource accessible over the internet.</strong><br></li><br>
        <li>Explain the significance of the root directory in a file  <br><strong><br>Answer..The root directory is the top-most directory in a file system hierarchy. It serves as the starting point for navigating the entire file system. In Unix-like systems, it's represented by a single forward slash ("/"), while in Windows, it's usually denoted by the drive letter followed by a colon (e.g., "C:"). Understanding the root directory is crucial because all other directories and files are organized hierarchically beneath it. It provides a frame of reference for specifying the location of any file or directory within the file system.</strong><br></li><br>
        <li>How do you link an external stylesheet to an HTML document?<br><strong><br>Answer..To link an external stylesheet to an HTML document, you use the <link> tag within the <head> section of your HTML file. Here's the basic syntax:
<!-- Your HTML content goes here -->
            html
            Copy code

        <li>Explain the structure of an HTML form. <br><strong><br>Answer..An HTML form consists of several elements:

            form element: This is the container for all the form elements. It typically contains attributes like action (specifying where the form data should be sent) and method (specifying the HTTP method to use when sending the form data).
            
            Input elements: These are used to collect user input. Common input types include text, password, radio buttons, checkboxes, buttons, etc. Each input element is enclosed within <input> tags and may have attributes like type, name, value, etc.
            
            extarea element: This is used for multiline text input.
            
            select element: This creates a dropdown list from which the user can select one or more options.</strong></li><br>
        <li>What are the different types of form inputs available in HTML?<br><strong><br>Answer..In HTML, there are several types of form inputs available:These inputs allow users to interact with and submit data through web forms. </strong><br></li><br>
        <li>How do you group related form elements together in HTML?<br><strong><br>Answer..In HTML, you can group related form elements together using the <fieldset> element, and then label them using the <legend> element. Here's an example:

            html
            Copy code
            <form>
              <fieldset>
                <legend>Contact Information</legend>
                <label for="name">Name:</label>
                <input type="text" id="name" name="name"><br>
                <label for="email">Email:</label>
                <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br>
              </fieldset>
            </form>
            This creates a visual grouping of the form elements under the "Contact Information" heading.
            </strong></li><br>
        <li>Describe the purpose of the action attribute in a form tag. <br><strong><br>Answer..The action attribute in a form tag specifies the URL where the form data will be sent upon submission. It defines the endpoint or destination where the form data will be processed, usually by a server-side script or application.</strong></li><br>
        <li>What is the significance of the method attribute in a form tag?<br><strong><br>Answer..The method attribute in a <form> tag specifies the HTTP method used when submitting the form data to the server. It defines how the form data will be sent. The two most commonly used methods are GET and POST.

            GET method appends the form data to the URL in the form of query parameters, visible in the address bar. It is typically used for requests that retrieve data from the server.
            POST method sends the form data in the request body, which is not visible in the URL. It is used for requests that submit data to the server, often for actions that modify data on the server.
            Other less commonly used methods include PUT, DELETE, and PATCH, which are often used in RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.</strong></li><br>
        <li>How do you create a dropdown/select menu in HTML?<br><strong><br>Answer..To create a dropdown/select menu in HTML, you can use the <select> element along with <option> elements. Here's a basic example:

            html
            Copy code
            <select>
              <option value="option1">Option 1</option>
              <option value="option2">Option 2</option>
              <option value="option3">Option 3</option>
            </select>
            Each <option> element represents an item in the dropdown menu. The value attribute defines the value associated with each option, which is what gets submitted to the server when the form is submitted. The text between the <option> tags is what is displayed to the user in the dropdown menu.</strong></li><br>
        <li>Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission <br><strong><br>Answer..The main difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission lies in how the data is sent to the server:

            GET Method:
            
            Data is appended to the URL as a query string.
            Limited amount of data can be sent (typically up to 2048 characters).
            Data is visible in the URL, which can pose security risks, especially for sensitive information like passwords.
            Suitable for sending small amounts of non-sensitive data, such as search queries.
            Data is cached by the browser, which may lead to security concerns if the data contains sensitive information.
            POST Method:
            
            Data is sent in the HTTP request body.
            Can send larger amounts of data compared to GET method.
            Data is not visible in the URL, enhancing security and privacy.
            Suitable for sending sensitive information like passwords or personal details.
            Data is not cached by the browser, reducing security risks associated with storing sensitive information.</strong></li><br>
